        "incident_description":"K9 Preacher succumbed to gunshot wounds he received while pursuing a fleeing domestic suspect on Ranger Street in Portage Lake, Maine. \n\nLaw enforcement responded to a report of a domestic situation and convinced the subject to talk to them outside of the home. As officers attempted to arrest the suspect, he pulled out a gun and fired at officers, striking an Aroostook County Sheriff's deputy in the shoulder. The suspect was able to barricade himself in the home despite hours of negotiations. When the suspect attempted to escape, his vehicle was disabled, so he fled on foot with K9 Preacher in pursuit. The suspect fired at K9 Preacher, hitting him in the abdomen. \n\nA Maine State Police trooper returned fire, killing the suspect. \n\nThe deputy was taken to a local hospital for treatment and was released. \n\nK9 Preacher was transported to an emergency veterinary hospital and survived surgery, but he passed away the following morning. \n\nK9 Preacher had served with the Maine State Police for over one year.",
